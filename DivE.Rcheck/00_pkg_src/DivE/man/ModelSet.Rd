List of 58 candidate models to fit to data
}
\description{
\emph{ModelSet} is an example list of candidate models used in the reference below to calculate the \emph{DivE} estimate
}
\usage{data(ModelSet)}
\format{
  A list of 58 named functions (with named parameters). Each model in the list must be provided as a function, and must be of the following form: function(x, params){ with(as.list(params), <\emph{function of params}>)}. The parameter names are a1, a2, a3, etc. These must match the names of the parameter values given in \emph{ParamSeeds} and \emph{ParamRanges}. 
}
\details{
Each model is written as a function: function(x, params) {with(as.list(params), <\emph{function of params}>)}. Examples are given in the \emph{ModelSet} data file as part of the \emph{DivE} package. The user can amend \emph{ModelSet} and input additional models as required. The analytical form of all the models provided in \emph{ModelSet} can be found in the reference below, in Text S1: List of \emph{DivE} candidate models. All models were obtained from \emph{zunzun.org}, an online curve fitting repository
